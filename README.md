# DELAYED.

> "The quieter you become, the more you can hear."

**DELAYED.** is a philosophical anti-impulse engine designed to combat reactive digital communication. It is a communication interface that forces a "cooling-off period" on every message, post, or thought before it is allowed to reach the world. 

The application uses biometric-style heuristics (typing speed, backspace frequency, and sentiment analysis) to calculate a "Volatility Index," which determines exactly how long a user must wait before their words become permanent.

## 🛠 The Mechanics of Friction

Unlike modern apps designed for speed, **DELAYED.** is built on **intentional friction**.

### 1. The Volatility Index
The system monitors your state of mind through your interaction with the keyboard:
* **Heat Index (WPM):** High typing speeds suggest agitation, increasing the delay.
* **Indecision (Backspaces):** Frequent corrections signal uncertainty; the system adds time to let you find clarity.
* **Intensity (Caps Ratio):** Excessive capitalization triggers a "loudness" penalty.
* **Impulse Tax:** Using the "Emotion Engine," the app detects anger or excitement and adds hours—or days—to the cooling period.

### 2. The Cooling Zone
Once an artifact (message) is "fossilized," it enters a queue. 
* **Visibility:** You can see your message cooling, but you cannot edit it.
* **The Phantom Chance:** A small percentage of messages are designated as "Phantoms"—they are released into the archive but never actually transmitted, simulating the relief of venting without the consequence of speaking.

### 3. The Regret Gateway
Users can cancel a pending message, but it comes at a cost:
* **Karma Debt:** Canceling an impulse lowers your "Zen" score.
* **Regret Debt Multiplier:** Frequent cancellations cause the system to "glitch," increasing all future delay timers as the system learns you are an unreliable narrator of your own intentions.
* **The Hold:** To purge a message, you must type a specific phrase and hold a button for 10 seconds—a manual labor requirement for digital silence.

## 🎨 Aesthetic: Brutalist Zen
The UI is built on a high-contrast, monochrome palette (Black/White/Zinc) with a **Fossilized Mono** aesthetic. 
* **Temporal Echoes:** Occasionally, the app surfaces "ghosts" of messages you almost sent months ago, reminding you of the version of yourself that the system saved you from.
* **Glitch State:** When your Regret Debt is too high, the interface begins to shake and pulse, reflecting a fractured mental state.

## 📋 Technical Stack
* **Framework:** React + TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Brutalist configuration)
* **Icons:** Lucide-React
* **State Management:** LocalStorage Persistence (The system never forgets your debt)
* **Logic:** Custom "Volatility Engine" for real-time delay calculation.

## 🧘 Purpose
In an era of instant regret and digital volatility, **DELAYED.** asks a single question: 
**If you had to wait 24 hours to say "I hate you," would you still say it?**
